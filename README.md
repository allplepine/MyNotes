# Repository for Large Model Theory and Code Implementation​

Welcome to this repository! This is a space dedicated to recording theoretical knowledge and code implementations related to large models. Currently, the focus of the repository is on sorting out and summarizing the core theoretical parts of large models, and complete code implementations have not yet been included. As research progresses, we will gradually add more dimensions of content.​
​
​
# 🌟 Focus of Existing Theoretical Content​
Currently, the theoretical content sorted out in the repository mainly revolves around crucial basic concepts in large models, including:​
Attention mechanism is one of the key focuses. We have elaborated on its core principles:​
How to realize the weight allocation of different elements in the input sequence​
Its role in improving the model's ability to capture key information​
Application characteristics of various variants (self-attention, cross-attention, etc.) in different scenarios​
# 📅 Future Plans​
Since it is not yet clear what specific content the repository will eventually cover, we will adopt a progressive update approach:​
Gradually add more theoretical knowledge related to large models (such as details of Transformer architecture, principles of pre-training and fine-tuning, etc.)​
After the theoretical part is relatively complete, supplement the corresponding code implementations simultaneously​
Finally realize the organic combination of theory and practice​
# 🤝 Participation and Communication​
